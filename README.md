# Alternative-Persona-5-music
Changes a lot of bgm

Songs changed:
rivers in the desert
velvet room tunes
blooming villain
keeper of lust
beneath the mask
last suprise 
sunset bridge
layer cake
sweatshop
the days my mother was here
phantom
victory
butterfly kiss
life will change
price

Songs I really wanna change:
a woman
security and freedom
mementos

Atlus for making some amazing music and remixes!

Dj CUTMAN, Half assed covers, Dodger and Gamechops for the amazing beneath the mask cover.
MeRuleDaWorld for the Sunset Bridge cover I didn't think I needed but now I need it in my life.
Theultimateonejpsx for the Phantom Dual Mix which I really like.
RandomPage for the Butterfly Kiss remix which was her first one but sounds so great and like something that belongs in the game.
People who made remixes for Persona 5 dancing: Shacho, Konishi, Kitajoh, Taku Takahashi, Meguro, Mito, Yukihiro, Shacho.
There were more people but they didn't publish their name under the work.
If I forgot someone I would be truly sorry but these are the people I could find.

I do not own any of the music in this mod.
